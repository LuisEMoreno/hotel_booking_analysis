# hotel_booking_analysis

Welcome!

My name is Luis Moreno. Im a Management career bachelor degree with an entusiastic learning side into technologies that is set to change
the world as we know it. 
This litle project involves data analysis. The scope is to use data from a hotel_bookings to discover insigths on how to increase general
income. First, i'm exploring the dataset on almost each column to grasp a general idea on how to use the data into the scope favour, and then
I'm diving into describing ideas and finding evidence on how to increase income.
Although i would prefer to use Python to perform analysis. SQL is also a nice tool, and this is the DB technologu that im using for this 
project.
