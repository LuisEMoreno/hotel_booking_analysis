# hotel_booking_analysis

Welcome!

My name is Luis Moreno. Im a Management career bachelor degree with an entusiastic learning side into technologies that is set to change
the world as we know it. 
This litle project involves data analysis. The scope is to use data from a hotel_bookings to discover insigths on how to increase general
income. First, i'm exploring the dataset on almost each column to grasp a general idea on how to use the data into the scope favour, and then
I'm diving into describing ideas and finding evidence on how to increase income.
Although i would prefer to use Python to perform analysis. SQL is also a nice tool, and this is the DB technologu that im using for this 
project.

The dataset im working on is hotel_bookings.csv. This file has been used for many other analysts. The data comes from this link
https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data

General_View is a broad and general analysis on the dataset. There are 30 queries and each one consists on a general description of the query made, the code of the query and the results it gave me.
